    	<h1>This is my review site<br>Please browse at my reviews</h1>
    	<p>I have always had a passion for video games, and would always seek reviews out before I made my purchase,
      but to many times I would believe someone who was paid by a gaming company to say false things about their product.</p>
    	<p>So out of frustration of not knowing who to made true reviews, I decided to start my own reviewing company!
      I dont take a dime from gaming companies, plus I am a average gamer as well so you know you will get the review you are looking for.</p>
    	<p><b>UPDATE</b> Ive started to do reviews on movies and other tech products as well. Send me and email on what you all think!</p>
    <h3>#1 Gaming Review!</h3>
    <a href="reviews/mario.html" ><img src="images/mario.jpg" alt="Mario image"></a>
    <p><b>Classic Mario!</b></p>
		<h3>Questions?</h3>
    	<p>If you have any questions about a review a made or would like me to make a review, please dont hesitate to leave me and email at
